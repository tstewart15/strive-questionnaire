Strive coding challenge

## Instructions
- Run `npm start`

## App Details
- Node version: 8.9.3

## Incomplete due to time constraints
- Full email address validation using regex
- More user input error feedback
- Allow typical form keyboard controls in UI (e.g. Enter to submit/advance)
- Actually wait for server success/error on submission before going to last page (displaying error if something went wrong)
